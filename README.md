## Apollo Federation Gateway Replacement

This library can be used as a replacement for the Apollo Federation Gateway.
It implements the [Apollo Federation Specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/federation-spec/).

In addition to the scope of other implementations, this one supports **Subscriptions!**

Check out the [Demo](/examples/federation).

## Overview

This repository implements low level building blocks to write graphql services in Go.

With this library you could build tools like:
- proxies
- caches
- server/client implementations
- a WAF
- be creative! =)

Currently implemented:

- GraphQL AST as of https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018
- Token lexing
- AST parsing: parse bytes/string into AST
- AST printing: print an AST to an io.Writer
    - supports indentation
- AST validation:
    - all rules from the spec implemented
- AST visitor:
    - simple visitor: fastest implementation, without field type definition information
    - visitor: a bit more overhead but has field type definitions and other quirks
- AST normalization
    - remove unnecessary include/skip directives
    - field deduplication
    - field selection merging
    - fragment definition removal
    - fragment spread inlining
    - inline fragment merging
    - remove self aliasing
    - type extension merging
    - remove type extensions
- Introspection: transforms a graphql schema into a resolvable Data Source
- AST execution
    - query planning: turns a Query AST into a cacheable execution plan
        - supported DataSources:
            - GraphQL (multiple GraphQL services can be combined)
            - static (static embedded data)
            - REST
    - query execution: takes a context object and executes an execution plan
- Middleware:
    - Operation Complexity: Calculates the complexity of an operation based on the GitHub algorithm
- OperationReport: Makes it easy to collect errors during all phases of a request and enables easy error printing according to the GraphQL spec
- Playground: Easy hosting of GraphQL Playground (no external dependencies, simple middleware) 
- Import Statements: combine multiple GraphQL files into one single schema using #import statements
- Implements the Apollo Federation Specification: Replacement for Apollo Federation Gateway 

## Go version Info

This repos uses go modules so make sure to use the latest version of Go.

## Docs

https://godoc.org/github.com/wundergraph/graphql-go-tools

## Usage

Look into the docs.
Other than that, tests definitely help understanding this library.

## Testing

`make test`

## Linting

`make lint`

## Performance

Most hot path operations have 0 allocations.
You should expect this library to exceed all alternatives in terms of performance.
I've compared my implementation vs. others but why trust my numbers?
Feel free to add comparisons via PR.

## Benchmarks

Parse Kitchen Sink (1020 chars, example from Facebook):
```shell script
pkg: github.com/wundergraph/graphql-go-tools/pkg/astparser
BenchmarkKitchenSink 	  189426	      5652 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkKitchenSink 	  198253	      5526 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkKitchenSink 	  199924	      5553 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
BenchmarkKitchenSink 	  212695	      5804 ns/op	       0 B/op	       0 allocs/op
```

CPU and Memory consumption for lexing, parsing as well as most other operations is neglectable, even for larger queries.

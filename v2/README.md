# GraphQL Router / API Gateway Framework written in Golang

[<p align="center"><img height="auto" src="./assets/logo.png"></p>](https://wundergraph.com/)

## Replacement for Apollo Router

If you're looking for a complete ready-to-use Open Source Router for Federation,
have a look at the [Cosmo Router](https://github.com/wundergraph/cosmo) which is based on this library.

Cosmo Router wraps this library and provides a complete solution for Federated GraphQL including the following features:
- [x] Federation Gateway
- [x] OpenTelemetry Metrics & Distributed Tracing
- [x] Prometheus Metrics
- [x] GraphQL Schema Usage Exporter
- [x] Health Checks
- [x] GraphQL Playground
- [x] Execution Tracing Exporter & UI in the Playground
- [x] Federated Subscriptions over WebSockets (graphql-ws & graphql-transport-ws protocol support) and SSE
- [x] Authentication using JWKS & JWT
- [x] Highly available & scalable using S3 as a backend for the Router Config
- [x] Persisted Operations / Trusted Documents
- [x] Traffic Shaping (Timeouts, Retries, Header & Body Size Limits, Subgraph Header forwarding)
- [x] Custom Modules & Middleware

## Notes

This library is used in production at [WunderGraph](https://wundergraph.com/).
We've recently introduced a v2 module that is not completely backwards compatible with v1, hence the major version bump.
The v2 module contains big rewrites in the engine package, mainly to better support GraphQL Federation.
Please consider the v1 module as deprecated and move to v2 as soon as possible.

We have customers who pay us to maintain this library and steer the direction of the project.
[Contact us](https://wundergraph.com/contact/sales) if you're looking for commercial support, features or consulting.

## Performance

The architecture of this library is designed for performance, high-throughput and low garbage collection overhead.
The following benchmark measures the "overhead" of loading and resolving a GraphQL response from four static in-memory Subgraphs at 0,007459 ms/op.
In more complete end-to-end benchmarks, we've measured up to 8x more requests per second and 8x lower p99 latency compared to Apollo Router, which is written in Rust.

We've now seen how to analyze the document and learn a bit about it.
We could now add some validation to our application,
e.g. we could check for the number of operations in the document,
and return an error if there are multiple anonymous operations.

We could also validate the Operation content against a schema.
But before we do this, we need to normalize the document.
This is important because validation relies on the document being normalized.
It was much easier to build the validation and many other features on top of a normalized document.

Normalization is the process of transforming the document into a canonical form.
This means that the document is transformed in a way that makes it easier to reason about it.
We inline fragments, we remove unused fragments,
we remove duplicate fields, we remove unused variables,
we remove unused operations etc...

So, let's normalize the document!

Good job! We now have a correct cache key for the document.
We're using this ourselves in production to de-duplicate e.g. planning the execution of a GraphQL Operation.

There's just one problem with the above code.
An attacker could easily send the same document with a different Operation name and get a different cache key.
This could quite easily fill up our cache with duplicate entries.
To prevent this, we can make the operation name static.
Let's change out code to account for this.

/*
With these changes, the name of the operation doesn't matter anymore.
Independent of the name, the cache key will always be the same.

As a next step, we could start planning the execution of the operation.
This is a very complex topic, so we'll just show you how to plan the operation.
Going into detail would be beyond the scope of this example.
It took us years to get this right, so we won't be able to explain it in a few lines of code.

graphql-go-tools is not a GraphQL server by itself.
It's a library that you can use to build Routers, Gateways, or even GraphQL Server frameworks on top of it.
What this means is that there's no built-in support to define "resolvers".
Instead, you have to define DataSources that are used to resolve fields.

A DataSource can be anything, e.g. a static value, a HTTP JSON API, a GraphQL API, a WASM Lambda, a Database etc.
It's up to you to implement the DataSource interface.

The simplest DataSource is the StaticDataSource.
It's a DataSource that returns a static value for a field.
Let's see how to use it!

You have to attach the DataSource to one or more fields in the schema,
and you have to provide a config and a factory for the DataSource,
so that the planner knows how to create an execution plan for the DataSource and an "instance" of the DataSource.
*/

func ExamplePlanOperation() {
    staticDataSource, err := plan.NewDataSourceConfiguration[staticdatasource.Configuration](
      "StaticDataSource",

          },
        },
      },
      staticdatasource.Configuration{
        Data: `{"hello":"world"}`,
      },
    )
  
    config := plan.Configuration{
      DataSources: []plan.DataSource{
        staticDataSource,
      },
      Fields: []plan.FieldConfiguration{
        {
          TypeName:              "Query", // attach this config to the Query type and the field hello
          FieldName:             "hello",
          DisableDefaultMapping: true,              // disable the default mapping for this field which only applies to GraphQL APIs
          Path:                  []string{"hello"}, // returns the value of the field "hello" from the JSON data
        },

	operationName := "O"

	planner := plan.NewPlanner(context.Background(), config)
	executionPlan := planner.Plan(operationDocument, schemaDocument, operationName, report)
	if report.HasErrors() {
		panic(report.Error())
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v", executionPlan) // Output: Plan...
}

/*
As you can see, the planner has created a plan for us.
This plan can now be executed by using the Resolver.
*/

func ExampleExecuteOperation() {
	var preparedPlan plan.Plan
	resolver := resolve.New(context.Background(), true)

	ctx := resolve.NewContext(context.Background())

	switch p := preparedPlan.(type) {
	case *plan.SynchronousResponsePlan:
		out := &bytes.Buffer{}
		err := resolver.ResolveGraphQLResponse(ctx, p.Response, nil, out)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		fmt.Println(out.String()) // Output: {"data":{"hello":"world"}}

		// this is a Query, so we ignore Subscriptions for now, but they are supported

/*
Well done! You've now seen how to parse, print, validate, normalize, plan and execute a GraphQL document.
You've built a complete GraphQL API Gateway from scratch.
That said, this was really just the tip of the iceberg.

When you look under the hood of graphql-go-tools, you'll notice that a lot of its functionality is built on top of the AST,
more specifically on top of the "astvisitor" package.
It comes with a lot of useful bells and whistles that help you to solve complex problems.

You'll notice that almost everything, from normalization to printing, planning, validation, etc.
is built on top of the AST and the astvisitor package.

Let's take a look at a basic example of how to use the astvisitor package to build higher level functionality.
Here's a simple use case:

Let's walk through the AST of a GraphQL document and extract all tuples of (TypeName, FieldName).
This is useful, e.g. when you want to extract information about the fields that are used in a document.
*/

type visitor struct {
	walker                *astvisitor.Walker
	operation, definition *ast.Document
	typeFields            [][]string
}

func (v *visitor) EnterField(ref int) {
	// get the name of the enclosing type (Query)
	enclosingTypeName := v.walker.EnclosingTypeDefinition.NameString(v.definition)
	// get the name of the field (hello)
	fieldName := v.operation.FieldNameString(ref)
	// get the type definition of the field (String)
	definitionRef, exists := v.walker.FieldDefinition(ref)
	if !exists {
		return
	}
	// get the name of the field type (String)
	fieldTypeName := v.definition.FieldDefinitionTypeNameString(definitionRef)
	v.typeFields = append(v.typeFields, []string{enclosingTypeName, fieldName, fieldTypeName})
}

func ExampleWalkAST() {

	operationDocument := ast.NewSmallDocument() // containing the following query: query O { hello }
	schemaDocument := ast.NewSmallDocument()    // containing the following schema: type Query { hello: String }
	report := &operationreport.Report{}

	walker := astvisitor.NewWalker(24)

	vis := &visitor{
		walker:     &walker,
		operation:  operationDocument,
		definition: schemaDocument,
	}

	walker.RegisterEnterFieldVisitor(vis)
	walker.Walk(operationDocument, schemaDocument, report)
	if report.HasErrors() {
		panic(report.Error())
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v", vis.typeFields) // Output: [[Query hello String]]
}

/*
This is just a very basic example of what you can do with the astvisitor package,
but you can see that it's very powerful and flexible.

You can register callbacks for every AST node and do whatever you want with it.
In addition, the walker helps you to keep track of the current position in the AST,
and it can help you to figure out the enclosing type of a field,or the ancestors or a node.
